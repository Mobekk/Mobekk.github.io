My very first blog post!

This is where your actual post content goes...


#Why a blog you ask?

I never really though I would be the person to ever create a blog. When thinking about a blog I have always thought of the barbie/pink bloggers that i've been so traumatized from.(Having a twin sister will do that.)

However, I figured it was finally time to give it a shot. It was time to get my thoughts and experiences out there. This blog will be about everything security or other interesting things I find, from my personal projects to interesting things I get to experience in my day to day work.(Anonymized, of course. Can't be writing about "company secrets" can we now.)

I welcome you to join me in my ventures, my thoughts and my ideas.
