        I'm Bjørn, a cybersecurity engineer from Western-Norway who probably spends too much time on my computer.
        Most weekends you'll find me messing around with home lab setups or falling down rabbit holes trying to understand some new technology.
        I got into security because I like solving puzzles, and you get to experience so many different fields a long with it! I think the best way to get better at this stuff is to share what you learn and learn from others doing the same.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not neck-deep in vulnerability management or figuring out what people are actually trying to do from usually obfuscated requests at work, I'm hiking Norway's trails, gaming or throwing discs at the disc golf range. (Oh, and let's not forget my Motorcycle addiction - oh spring, oh spring, where are you?)

    <h2>Why This Blog</h2>
    <p>
        I created this blog to document things I learn, share solutions to problems I've solved, and contribute to the security community. If even one post helps someone solve a problem faster, that's a win. Oh, and also to challenge my creative outlet, which I have kept locked for so long.
